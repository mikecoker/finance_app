    "title": "Why Track Your Spending?",
    "content": "Tracking your spending reveals your actual financial habits, often highlighting patterns you weren't aware of. It helps identify areas where you might be overspending, ensures you're sticking to your budget, prevents impulse purchases, and provides data for refining your budget over time. Many people are surprised to discover how much they spend in certain categories once they start tracking."

Common categories include: Housing (rent/mortgage, utilities, maintenance), Transportation (car payments, gas, public transit), Food (groceries, dining out), Healthcare, Entertainment, Personal care, Debt payments, Savings, and Miscellaneous.

Look for: Categories where you consistently overspend, unexpected expenses that might need their own category, seasonal spending patterns, and opportunities to reduce spending.

If you consistently overspend in certain categories, either increase the budget allocation (by decreasing elsewhere) or find ways to reduce spending in those areas. If you find you've been unrealistic about certain expenses, update your budget to reflect reality. Remember, a budget is a living document that evolves as your financial situation and goals change."
