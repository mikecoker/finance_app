      "content": "A credit card is a payment card issued by a financial institution that lets you borrow money to pay for goods and services. Unlike a debit card, which immediately takes money from your bank account, a credit card allows you to borrow up to a certain limit and pay back the borrowed amount later.\n\nCredit cards operate on a revolving credit model, meaning you can repeatedly borrow up to your credit limit as long as you make minimum payments on what you've borrowed."

Here's the basic process:\n\n1. **Purchase**: You make a purchase using your credit card\n2. **Billing Cycle**: The purchase is added to your monthly statement\n3. **Grace Period**: You typically have 21-25 days to pay before interest is charged\n4. **Payment Options**: You can pay the full balance (avoiding interest) or make a minimum payment (accruing interest on the remaining balance)\n5. **Interest Charges**: If you don't pay in full, interest is applied to your remaining balance"
