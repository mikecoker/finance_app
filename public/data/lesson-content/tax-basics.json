    "content": "Taxes are mandatory financial charges imposed by governments on individuals and businesses to fund public services and infrastructure. These include everything from roads and schools to healthcare and national defense. Taxes are a legal obligation, and failure to pay can result in penalties or legal consequences."

    "title": "The Progressive Tax System",
    "content": "The U.S. uses a progressive income tax system, meaning tax rates increase as your income rises. Income is divided into tax brackets, each with its own rate. Importantly, only the income within each bracket is taxed at that bracket's rate—not your entire income. This is a common misconception that leads many to misunderstand how their taxes are calculated."

Most taxpayers must file their federal income tax return by April 15 of the following year (or the next business day if it falls on a weekend or holiday). Extensions are available, but they only extend the filing deadline, not the payment deadline—any taxes owed are still due by the original deadline."
