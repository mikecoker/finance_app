    "title": "What is Taxable Income?",
    "content": "Taxable income includes wages, salaries, tips, investment income (interest, dividends, capital gains), business income, rental income, and even unemployment benefits. Some income types are partially taxable (like Social Security benefits) while others may be tax-exempt (like municipal bond interest). Understanding what counts as taxable income is the first step in calculating your tax liability."

    "title": "Tax Deductions vs. Credits",
    "content": "Tax deductions reduce your taxable income before tax rates are applied. For example, a $1,000 deduction might save you $220 if you're in the 22% tax bracket. Tax credits, on the other hand, directly reduce your tax bill dollar-for-dollar. A $1,000 tax credit saves you exactly $1,000 regardless of your tax bracket, making credits generally more valuable than deductions of the same amount."

    "type": "content",
    "character": "taxxy",
    "title": "Standard vs. Itemized Deductions",
    "content": "When filing taxes, you can either take the standard deduction (a fixed amount based on filing status) or itemize deductions (listing individual deductible expenses). Itemizing makes sense when your eligible expenses (mortgage interest, state taxes, charitable donations, etc.) exceed the standard deduction. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 nearly doubled the standard deduction, making itemizing beneficial for fewer taxpayers."

Many credits have income limits and phase out as income increases."

The five filing statuses are: Single, Married Filing Jointly, Married Filing Separately, Head of Household, and Qualifying Widow(er). Choosing the correct status is crucial—married couples often benefit from filing jointly, while single parents may qualify for the more advantageous Head of Household status."
