    "content": "The two main types of tax-advantaged retirement accounts are Traditional and Roth. With Traditional accounts (401(k)s, IRAs), contributions are tax-deductible now, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed as income. With Roth accounts, contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are completely tax-free. Your choice depends on whether you expect to be in a higher or lower tax bracket in retirement."

These plans allow higher contribution limits than IRAs and often include employer matching contributionsâ€”essentially free money. For 2023, you can contribute up to $22,500 to a 401(k), plus an additional $7,500 if you're 50 or older. Always contribute at least enough to get the full employer match."

Eligibility for Roth IRA contributions phases out at higher income levels. IRAs offer more investment options than most employer plans but have lower contribution limits."
