      "content": "A personal loan is a fixed amount of money borrowed from a bank, credit union, or online lender that you repay in fixed monthly installments over a set period, typically 1-7 years. Unlike specific loans (like auto loans or mortgages), personal loans can be used for almost any purpose.\n\nPersonal loans are usually unsecured, meaning they don't require collateral like a house or car. Instead, approval is based primarily on your credit score, income, and existing debt."
