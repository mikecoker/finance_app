    "content": "Beyond the standard deduction, several specific deductions can reduce your taxable income: Mortgage interest on loans up to $750,000; State and local taxes (SALT) up to $10,000; Medical expenses exceeding 7.5% of your adjusted gross income; Charitable contributions; Student loan interest up to $2,500; and Self-employment expenses. Remember that you'll need to itemize deductions (except for certain ones like student loan interest) to claim these benefits."

    "content": "Some deductions, called 'adjustments to income' or 'above-the-line deductions,' can be claimed whether you itemize or take the standard deduction. These include contributions to traditional IRAs and HSAs, self-employed health insurance premiums, alimony payments for agreements before 2019, and the student loan interest deduction. These deductions directly reduce your adjusted gross income (AGI), which can help you qualify for other tax benefits."

    "content": "Tax credits come in two forms: Refundable credits can reduce your tax liability below zero, resulting in a refund even if you owe no tax. Examples include the Earned Income Tax Credit and a portion of the Child Tax Credit. Nonrefundable credits can only reduce your tax liability to zero, with no refund of any excess. Examples include the Child and Dependent Care Credit and the Lifetime Learning Credit."
