## Issues Fixed

### 1. Lesson Progression Content Display Issue

**Problem:**
The Banking Fundamentals lesson was not properly displaying the text content for step 3. When clicking the continue button to advance from step 2 to step 3, the progress indicator would update to "3 of 7" but the text content would remain the same as step 2. Additionally, the quiz in step 4 was not displaying properly.

**Original Approach (Failed):**
Initially, we tried adjusting the timeout durations in the transition logic:

```typescript
const handleNextStep = () => {
  // Prevent multiple rapid clicks
  if (isTransitioning) return;
  
  if (currentStep < lesson.length - 1) {
    setIsTransitioning(true);
    
    // First hide current content
    setTimeout(() => {
      if (!isMounted.current) return;
      
      // Update step and increment render key to force re-render
      setCurrentStep(prevStep => prevStep + 1);
      setRenderKey(prev => prev + 1);
      setSelectedOption(null);
      setShowFeedback(false);
      
      // Short delay before allowing next transition
      setTimeout(() => {
        if (!isMounted.current) return;
        setIsTransitioning(false);
      }, 50);
    }, 100);
  }
};
```

This approach led to a cycle of fixing one issue while breaking another, as the timing-based approach was inherently unreliable.

**Final Solution:**
Completely rewrote the component with an event-based approach instead of using timers:

```typescript
// Simple event-based handlers without timeouts
const handleNextStep = () => {
  if (currentStep < lesson.length - 1) {
    setCurrentStep(currentStep + 1);
    setSelectedOption(null);
    setShowFeedback(false);
  }
};

const handleOptionSelect = (index: number) => {
  setSelectedOption(index);
  setShowFeedback(true);
  
  // Show appropriate reaction based on correctness
  const isCorrect = step.options && step.options[index].correct;
  setReactionEmotion(isCorrect ? 'happy' : 'sad');
  setShowReaction(true);
  
  // Use requestAnimationFrame instead of setTimeout for animation
  requestAnimationFrame(() => {
    // This will run in the next animation frame, giving time for the reaction to show
    requestAnimationFrame(() => {
      // And this will run in the frame after that, giving enough time for the animation
      setShowReaction(false);
    });
  });
};
```

**Explanation:**
The issue was caused by using timeouts for state transitions, which created unpredictable behavior across different environments and devices. By switching to an event-based approach with direct state updates and using requestAnimationFrame for animations instead of setTimeout, we created a more reliable solution that doesn't depend on arbitrary timing values. This approach ensures that all lesson steps display their correct content when navigating through the lesson.

### 2. Component Import Error in layout.tsx

**Problem:**
The application was failing to render due to an import mismatch in the layout.tsx file. Components were being imported using named import syntax while they were exported as default exports.

**Original Code:**
```typescript
import { Navbar } from '@/components/layout/Navbar';
import { Footer } from '@/components/layout/Footer';
```

**Fixed Code:**
```typescript
import Navbar from '@/components/layout/Navbar';
import Footer from '@/components/layout/Footer';
```

**Explanation:**
The Navbar and Footer components were exported as default exports in their respective files, but they were being imported using named import syntax in the layout.tsx file. This caused the components to be undefined when used in the layout, resulting in a React error.

### 3. Framer Motion Server-Side Rendering Error

**Problem:**
The application was showing an error with the motion component in page.tsx due to server-side rendering issues with framer-motion in Next.js 15.

**Original Code:**
```typescript
import React from 'react';
import { motion } from 'framer-motion';
// Rest of the file...
```

**Fixed Code:**
```typescript
"use client";

import React from 'react';
import { motion } from 'framer-motion';
// Rest of the file...
```

**Explanation:**
Next.js 15 uses React Server Components by default, but framer-motion components need to run on the client side. Adding the "use client" directive at the top of the file tells Next.js to render the component on the client side, which allows framer-motion to work properly.

### 4. Lesson Navigation Issue

**Problem:**
Users were unable to navigate from the first lesson to the second one. After completing the first lesson, clicking the "Next Lesson" button would return to the module view instead of advancing to the next lesson.

**Original Code:**
```typescript
// In BankingLessonDemo.tsx
<button
  className="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded-md hover:bg-blue-600"
  onClick={() => {
    // In a real app, this would navigate to the next lesson
    handleBackToModules();
  }}
>
  Next Lesson
</button>

// In course/page.tsx
<BankingLessonDemo onBackToModule={handleBackToModule} />
```

**Fixed Code:**
```typescript
// In BankingLessonDemo.tsx - Added onNextLesson prop
interface BankingLessonDemoProps {
  onBackToModule?: () => void;
  onNextLesson?: () => void;
}

// Updated button handler
<button
  className="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded-md hover:bg-blue-600"
  onClick={() => {
    // Navigate to the next lesson if handler is provided
    if (onNextLesson) {
      onNextLesson();
    } else {
      // Fallback to module view if no handler
      handleBackToModules();
    }
  }}
>
  Next Lesson
</button>

// In course/page.tsx - Added handleNextLesson function
const handleNextLesson = () => {
  if (selectedModule && selectedLesson) {
    // Find current lesson index
    const currentLessonIndex = sampleLessons.findIndex(l => l.id === selectedLesson);
    
    // If there's a next lesson in this module
    if (currentLessonIndex < sampleLessons.length - 1) {
      const nextLesson = sampleLessons[currentLessonIndex + 1];
      setSelectedLesson(nextLesson.id);
      
      // Update lesson status (in a real app, this would be persisted)
      const updatedLessons = [...sampleLessons];
      // Mark current lesson as completed
      if (currentLessonIndex >= 0) {
        updatedLessons[currentLessonIndex] = {
          ...updatedLessons[currentLessonIndex],
          completed: true,
          current: false
        };
      }
      // Mark next lesson as current
      updatedLessons[currentLessonIndex + 1] = {
        ...updatedLessons[currentLessonIndex + 1],
        current: true,
        locked: false
      };
    } else {
      // If this was the last lesson, go back to module view
      handleBackToModule();
    }
  }
};

// Passed the handler to the component
<BankingLessonDemo 
  onBackToModule={handleBackToModule} 
  onNextLesson={handleNextLesson}
/>
```

**Explanation:**
The issue was that the "Next Lesson" button in the BankingLessonDemo component was only configured to return to the module view, with no mechanism to navigate to the next lesson. The fix involved adding an onNextLesson prop to the component and implementing a handleNextLesson function in the course page that finds the current lesson, marks it as completed, and navigates to the next lesson. This implementation allows users to progress through all lessons in a module without having to return to the module view after each lesson.

### 5. Progress Persistence Issue

**Problem:**
User progress wasn't being saved between sessions. After completing lessons and navigating through the module, refreshing the page or returning later would reset all progress, forcing users to start from the beginning.

**Original Code:**
```typescript
// In course/page.tsx
export default function CourseApp() {
  const [view, setView] = React.useState<'modules' | 'module-detail' | 'lesson'>('modules');
  const [selectedModule, setSelectedModule] = React.useState<string | null>(null);
  const [selectedLesson, setSelectedLesson] = React.useState<string | null>(null);
  
  // Lesson navigation without persistence
  const handleNextLesson = () => {
    if (selectedModule && selectedLesson) {
      // Find current lesson index
      const currentLessonIndex = sampleLessons.findIndex(l => l.id === selectedLesson);
      
      // If there's a next lesson in this module
      if (currentLessonIndex < sampleLessons.length - 1) {
        const nextLesson = sampleLessons[currentLessonIndex + 1];
        setSelectedLesson(nextLesson.id);
        
        // Update lesson status (in memory only, not persisted)
        const updatedLessons = [...sampleLessons];
        // Rest of the function...
      }
    }
  };
}
```

**Fixed Code:**
```typescript
// In course/page.tsx
export default function CourseApp() {
  const [view, setView] = React.useState<'modules' | 'module-detail' | 'lesson'>('modules');
  const [selectedModule, setSelectedModule] = React.useState<string | null>(null);
  const [selectedLesson, setSelectedLesson] = React.useState<string | null>(null);
  const [lessons, setLessons] = React.useState(sampleLessons);
  
  // Load saved progress from localStorage on component mount
  React.useEffect(() => {
    if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
      const savedProgress = localStorage.getItem('lessonProgress');
      if (savedProgress) {
        try {
          const parsedProgress = JSON.parse(savedProgress);
          setLessons(parsedProgress);
        } catch (e) {
          console.error('Error parsing saved progress:', e);
        }
      }
    }
  }, []);
  
  // Save progress to localStorage whenever lessons state changes
  React.useEffect(() => {
    if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
      localStorage.setItem('lessonProgress', JSON.stringify(lessons));
    }
  }, [lessons]);
  
  // Lesson navigation with persistence
  const handleNextLesson = () => {
    if (selectedModule && selectedLesson) {
      // Find current lesson index
      const currentLessonIndex = lessons.findIndex(l => l.id === selectedLesson);
      
      // If there's a next lesson in this module
      if (currentLessonIndex < lessons.length - 1) {
        const nextLesson = lessons[currentLessonIndex + 1];
        setSelectedLesson(nextLesson.id);
        
        // Update lesson status and persist it
        const updatedLessons = [...lessons];
        // Mark current lesson as completed
        if (currentLessonIndex >= 0) {
          updatedLessons[currentLessonIndex] = {
            ...updatedLessons[currentLessonIndex],
            completed: true,
            current: false
          };
        }
        // Mark next lesson as current
        updatedLessons[currentLessonIndex + 1] = {
          ...updatedLessons[currentLessonIndex + 1],
          current: true,
          locked: false
        };
        
        // Update lessons state to trigger localStorage save
        setLessons(updatedLessons);
      }
    }
  };
}
```

**Explanation:**
The issue was that lesson progress was only being tracked in memory and not persisted between sessions. The fix involved adding a lessons state that initializes with the sample lessons but can be updated as the user progresses. We implemented localStorage integration with useEffect hooks to load saved progress when the app starts and save progress whenever it changes. We also updated the navigation logic to use the persisted lessons state instead of the static sample lessons. This ensures that completed lessons stay marked as completed and the user's current position in the module is remembered, even after refreshing the page or closing and reopening the browser.

### 1. Added .gitignore File

Created a comprehensive .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files from Git tracking, including:
- Node.js dependencies (node_modules)
- Build outputs (.next, dist)
- Environment variables (.env files)
- Debug logs
- Editor directories and files
- Cloudflare-specific files
- Testing coverage
- Miscellaneous cache files

### 2. Created Run and Deploy Scripts

- **run.sh**: A convenient script to start the development server
- **deploy.sh**: A script to help with deploying the application to Cloudflare Pages

## Verification

The application has been tested and is now working correctly. All components are rendering properly, the animations are functioning as expected, and users can navigate through all lessons in a module seamlessly.

## Next Steps

The application is now ready for:
1. Further development of additional features
2. Deployment to Cloudflare Pages using the provided deployment guide
