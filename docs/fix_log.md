# Fix Log for Personal Finance Course Application

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Lesson Progression Content Display Issue

**Problem:**
The Banking Fundamentals lesson was not properly displaying the text content for step 3. When clicking the continue button to advance from step 2 to step 3, the progress indicator would update to "3 of 7" but the text content would remain the same as step 2.

**Original Code:**
```typescript
const handleNextStep = () => {
  // Prevent multiple rapid clicks
  if (isTransitioning) return;
  
  if (currentStep < lesson.length - 1) {
    setIsTransitioning(true);
    
    // First hide current content
    setTimeout(() => {
      if (!isMounted.current) return;
      
      // Update step and increment render key to force re-render
      setCurrentStep(prevStep => prevStep + 1);
      setRenderKey(prev => prev + 1);
      setSelectedOption(null);
      setShowFeedback(false);
      
      // Short delay before allowing next transition
      setTimeout(() => {
        if (!isMounted.current) return;
        setIsTransitioning(false);
      }, 50);
    }, 100);
  }
};
```

**Fixed Code:**
```typescript
const handleNextStep = () => {
  // Prevent multiple rapid clicks
  if (isTransitioning) return;
  
  if (currentStep < lesson.length - 1) {
    setIsTransitioning(true);
    
    // First hide current content with longer delay to ensure proper transition
    setTimeout(() => {
      if (!isMounted.current) return;
      
      // Update step and increment render key to force re-render
      setCurrentStep(prevStep => prevStep + 1);
      setRenderKey(prev => prev + 1);
      setSelectedOption(null);
      setShowFeedback(false);
      
      // Longer delay before allowing next transition to ensure content is fully rendered
      setTimeout(() => {
        if (!isMounted.current) return;
        setIsTransitioning(false);
      }, 300); // Increased from 50ms to 300ms
    }, 300); // Increased from 100ms to 300ms
  }
};
```

**Explanation:**
The issue was caused by the transition timing being too short for React to properly update the DOM between steps. The timeouts were increased from 50ms/100ms to 300ms to ensure content is fully rendered before allowing the next transition. This fix ensures that all lesson steps display their correct content when navigating through the lesson.

### 2. Component Import Error in layout.tsx

**Problem:**
The application was failing to render due to an import mismatch in the layout.tsx file. Components were being imported using named import syntax while they were exported as default exports.

**Original Code:**
```typescript
import { Navbar } from '@/components/layout/Navbar';
import { Footer } from '@/components/layout/Footer';
```

**Fixed Code:**
```typescript
import Navbar from '@/components/layout/Navbar';
import Footer from '@/components/layout/Footer';
```

**Explanation:**
The Navbar and Footer components were exported as default exports in their respective files, but they were being imported using named import syntax in the layout.tsx file. This caused the components to be undefined when used in the layout, resulting in a React error.

### 2. Framer Motion Server-Side Rendering Error

**Problem:**
The application was showing an error with the motion component in page.tsx due to server-side rendering issues with framer-motion in Next.js 15.

**Original Code:**
```typescript
import React from 'react';
import { motion } from 'framer-motion';
// Rest of the file...
```

**Fixed Code:**
```typescript
"use client";

import React from 'react';
import { motion } from 'framer-motion';
// Rest of the file...
```

**Explanation:**
Next.js 15 uses React Server Components by default, but framer-motion components need to run on the client side. Adding the "use client" directive at the top of the file tells Next.js to render the component on the client side, which allows framer-motion to work properly.

## Additional Improvements

### 1. Added .gitignore File

Created a comprehensive .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files from Git tracking, including:
- Node.js dependencies (node_modules)
- Build outputs (.next, dist)
- Environment variables (.env files)
- Debug logs
- Editor directories and files
- Cloudflare-specific files
- Testing coverage
- Miscellaneous cache files

### 2. Created Run and Deploy Scripts

- **run.sh**: A convenient script to start the development server
- **deploy.sh**: A script to help with deploying the application to Cloudflare Pages

## Verification

The application has been tested and is now working correctly. All components are rendering properly, and the animations are functioning as expected.

## Next Steps

The application is now ready for:
1. Further development of additional features
2. Deployment to Cloudflare Pages using the provided deployment guide
3. Mobile deployment using Capacitor as outlined in the technical specification
